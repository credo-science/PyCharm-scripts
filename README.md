# PyCharm-scripts
Scripts written in python using PyCharm.

# Data analysis
In the directory "data analysis" are included numerous examples of scripts to read data analysis and detection.

To start working in PyCharm, we recommend that you create a new project and add interesting scripts (or all) to it, add "envm" to the project (the Pycharm environment creates it when creating the project) and then install the necessary libraries that are not on the computer. The "envm" folder was not added to the package because its weight is more than 500 MB
