The main purpose of scripts in this folder ("time analysis") is to operate on the time included in pings and detections.

The time from pings will allow us to determine
how often devices connect to the database,
what delays in sending or counting the detection work occur

Time from detection will allow us to see
how often detections are detected,
and how long they are sent to the base.
